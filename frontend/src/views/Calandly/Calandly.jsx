              1) The Slot you select could be changed based on Student's Grade and our faculty's availability. We try
our best to give everyone the same slots as chosen. We will inform you over a phone call and give you options to choose from!
            </p>

            <p>
              2) You are free to bring along other students for the free demo (upto 4 additional friends). However,
Please inform us in the form or via a phone call or whatsapp so we can plan accordingly. Students should carry a notebook and a pen 
to take any notes. Please arrive on time. We do not have any car parking, so request parents to use the parking by the
roadside. Shubh enclave gives enough free parking and is only 2 minutes walk away
